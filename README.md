# Language Optimization Tool

Tool implemented during the Masters Thesis "Generalized Optimization Models of
Linguistic Laws".

Compile:

```
make
```

Compile and run tests (might take a long time):

```
make test_internal
```

The tool expects a directory to be passed as parameter. This directory must
contain a file `config.yaml` from which the parameters of the simulation will
be read.

A sample configuration file can be found in the given [sample file](sample.yaml).
